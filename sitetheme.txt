HelloRun theme

HelloRun is about movement, momentum, and shared progress.
The icon shows a runner stepping forward inside a conversation shape.
That tells you this platform is not only about finishing a run, but about staying connected, motivated, and visible as you move.
The warm runner signals energy and action.
The cool background signals trust, clarity, and community.
Together, they frame HelloRun as a friendly, social space where running is simple, inclusive, and goal driven.

You are not just tracking distance.
You are joining a conversation around consistency, health, and achievement.
