CHANGELOG - February 27, 2026 (Session: Organizer UX + Event Reference Code Persistence)
================================================================================

[SESSION] SESSION UPDATE:
- Improved organizer-facing language and records UX; introduced persistent event reference codes.

[UPDATED] UPDATED FILES (major):
  1. src/routes/organizer.routes.js
     - Create-event success now redirects to /organizer/events (My Events)
     - Added referenceCode generation during event creation

  2. src/models/Event.js
     - Added referenceCode field (unique, sparse, immutable)

  3. src/views/organizer/events.ejs
     - Replaced technical label wording:
       - "slug" -> "Event URL" (search placeholder + card label)

  4. src/views/organizer/event-details.ejs
     - Replaced "Audit" section with user-friendly "Event Record"
     - Added:
       - Reference Code display
       - Organizer name and public event path display
       - Copy Reference Code / Copy Event Link actions
       - Collapsible "Technical details" for raw Event ID/Organizer ID
     - Now uses stored event.referenceCode (fallback kept for legacy records)

  5. src/public/css/event-manage.css
     - Added styles for Event Record actions and technical details block

  6. package.json
     - Added script:
       - backfill:event-reference-codes

       - collision-safe suffixing: -02, -03, ...

  2. src/scripts/backfill-event-reference-codes.js
     - One-time backfill tool for existing events missing referenceCode

KEY BEHAVIOR CHANGES:
  - New events now persist a unique user-facing referenceCode
  - Organizer create-event flow lands on My Events after successful save/publish
  - Organizer event details hide raw IDs behind technical toggle
  - UI language is less technical ("Event URL" instead of "slug")

MANUAL SMOKE CHECKLIST (Latest):
  [ ] Create event redirects to /organizer/events with success message
  [ ] New events store referenceCode in MongoDB
  [ ] Existing events backfilled via npm run backfill:event-reference-codes
  [ ] Event details show Reference Code and copy buttons work
