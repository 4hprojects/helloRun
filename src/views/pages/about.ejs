          <p>Welcome to <strong>HelloRun.online</strong> — where movement meets momentum in a running community built for real people who show up and move forward. One recent survey found that people who join run challenges are <strong>twice as likely to stay consistent</strong> with activity tracking and personal goals. That's the kind of progress we're focused on.</p>
          
          <p>HelloRun isn't just about logging miles or tracking runs. It's about shared progress, staying motivated, and being part of a running community that actually moves with you. You run on your own schedule. You still feel part of something bigger. You get simple tools that help you log your run, track your progress, and connect with others without the noise of complicated apps.</p>
